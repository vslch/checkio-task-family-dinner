<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
Dr. Mickhead's family is visiting him the next Sunday to have dinner all together. 
He wishes the party to be really special, so he plans to use his best plates for 
the table setting. Dr. Mickhead has N stacks of plates. Each stack contains K plates. 
Each plate has a positive beauty value, describing how beautiful it looks. Dr. Mickhead 
would like to take exactly P plates to use for the dinner. If he would like to take 
a plate from a stack, he must also take all of the plates above it in that stack as well.
Help Dr. Mickhead to calculate the maximum of the total sum of beauty values that can
be achieved by picking P plates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note: </strong> P is always less or equal than total amount of plates in all stacks.

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>
	<p>
		Two arguments
		<ul>
			<li>
			First - list of lists of equal size. The i-th list contains positive integers, 
			describing the beauty values of i-th stack of plates from top to bottom;
			</li>
			<li>
			Second - positive integer. The amount of plates Dr. Mickhead is willing to put
			on the table.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>
	<p>
	An integer - the maximum of the total sum of beauty values that can be achieved 
	with respect to the constraints.
	</p>

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
	<p>
	Consider the following input: <i>[[10, 10, 100, 30], [80, 50, 10, 50,]], 5</i>.
	So the best option would be picking 3 plates from the first stack 
	and 2 plates from the second stack. In total, the sum of beauty values is 250.
	<pre class="for_info_only">
	[10, 10, 100, _] -> total: 10 + 10 + 100 = 120
	[80, 50,   _, _] -> total: 80 + 50       = 130
	----------------------------------------------
	                    total: 120 + 130     = 250
	</pre>
	</p>

<pre class="brush: python">
best_plates([[10, 10, 100, 30], 
             [80, 50, 10, 50,]], 5) == 250
			 
best_plates([[80, 80],
             [15, 50],
             [20, 10]], 3) == 180
